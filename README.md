This site is inspired by Codecademy ads: NASA ðŸš€.</br>
When I saw the ad, I was amazed. Work in tech has always been a dream of mine, hence i learn about programing but i never thought i could've dream bigger. In the Codecademy's ads, they show how one of their graduates is working in NASA and i thought _"hey that's my childhood dream"._ Work in NASA and make a difference in the world. I was inspired by that and decided to make this website.</br>
Yes, i know its good to be true, but hey, one can dream right?
